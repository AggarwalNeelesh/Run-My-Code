    "2":"You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.",

    "7":"Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).",
    "8":"Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. '123' -> 123, '0032' -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.Return the integer as the final result.",
